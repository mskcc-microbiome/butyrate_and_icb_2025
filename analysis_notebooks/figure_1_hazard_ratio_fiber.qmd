The data we are visualizing here has the following structure:


```{r}
#| warning: false
#| include: false
#| label: load_data


```

## Panel A

Mortality Hazard for PFS by daily average fiber intake, visualized via partial smoothing spline.  Ticks along the x axis represent individual patients. 

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| include: false
#| label: panel_a


```

## Panel B

Mortality Hazard for OS by daily average fiber intake, visualized via partial smoothing spline.  Ticks along the x axis represent individual patients. 

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| include: false
#| label: panel_b


```

## Panel C

Kaplan-Meier PFS by daily average fiber intake, two groups >= 15 grams/day.  

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| include: false
#| label: panel_c


```

## Panel D

Kaplan-Meier OS by daily average fiber intake, two groups >= 15 grams/day. 

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| include: false
#| label: panel_d


```

## Panel E
Univariate HRs for PFS among clinically relavant subgroups.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| include: false
#| label: panel_e


```

## Panel F

Multivariate HR for PFS adjusted for age, diagnosis, and performance status.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| include: false
#| label: panel_f
