## What is ShortBRED? (and what did we use it for?)

[ShortBRED](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/shortbred/) is a tool developed by the Huttenhower group for profiling specific protein families of interest using shotgun metagenomic data.  

In this project it was used to profile genes involved in butyrate synthesis using a set of genes identified by Vital et al in their paper [Revealing the Bacterial Butyrate Synthesis Pathways by Analyzing (Meta)genomic Data](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00889-14).  

Genes used in this analysis were downloaded from the [Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes database](https://img.jgi.doe.gov/).  A fastq file which acted as our ShortBRED database for this analysis is included in [the Github repo](https://github.com/mskcc-microbiome/butyrate_and_icb_2025/tree/main/data_processing/shortbred_analysis) for this project. 

### Steps for running our ShortBRED analysis:

#### Step 0: Get software etc:

To get started - you will need:

  - Code from our repo!  Get this by cloning the repo (`git clone git@github.com:mskcc-microbiome/butyrate_and_icb_2025.git` (SSH) or `git clone https://github.com/mskcc-microbiome/butyrate_and_icb_2025.git` (HTTPS)) or by downloading the files required.  In particular you will need:
    - the `data_processing/shortbred_analysis/` folder with our required scripts for running our `ShortBRED` analysis.
  - Download (or locate) a copy of [usearch](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/)
  - Download a copy of [shortBRED](https://github.com/biobakery/shortbred)

#### Step 1: Update config file:

  - Please open the config file in `data_processing/shortbred_analysis/config.yaml` and edit the following parameters:
  

### Run an example:

To run the example of this `shortBRED` code on one of the fastqs from this project:

#### Step 0: 

- Follow the steps in setup or in the `data_processing/shortbred_analysis/README.md` to set up your environment for running this code. 

#### Step 1:

- Download a test file, ie: one of the fastqs from [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA1190411)

#### Step 2:

- Run our `Snakemake` pipeline on this file:
