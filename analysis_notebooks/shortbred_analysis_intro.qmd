## What is ShortBRED? (and what did we use it for?)

ShortBRED is a [tool developed by the Huttenhower group](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/shortbred/) for profiling/identifying against specific protein families of interest using shotgun metagenomic sequencing data.  In this project it was used to profile genes involved in butyrate synthesis using a set of genes identified by Vital et al in their paper [Revealing the Bacterial Butyrate Synthesis Pathways by Analyzing (Meta)genomic Data](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00889-14).  Genes used in this analysis were downloaded from the [Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes database](https://img.jgi.doe.gov/).  A fastq file including the exact genes used in the analysis for this paper is included in this Github repo for this project.
