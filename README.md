Public Analysis Notebooks to go along with the manuscript "Dietary fiber intake and gut microbial fiber fermentation capacity are associated with favorable clinical outcomes following immune checkpoint blockade".  The accompanying documentation for this project can be found [here](https://mskcc-microbiome.github.io/butyrate_and_icb_2025/)

Additional data processing steps are in the `data_processing` folder.  A detailed description of how we performed the ShortBRED analysis to generate the list of butyrate genes is in the `shortbred_analysis` sub-folder in `data_processing`.  Instructions/background on the ShortBRED analysis can also be found in the [accompanying documentation](https://mskcc-microbiome.github.io/butyrate_and_icb_2025/shortbred_analysis_intro.html) 

Please use the `renv.lock` file associated with this project to find the libraries used in this analysis.
